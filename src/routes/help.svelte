<h3>Using LAHS Classes</h3>
<p>LAHS Classes is a directory of all courses available at Los Altos High School. It shows potential options on what classes you can take, based on the school's recommended student pathways, and helps you plan your next choices.</p>
<h4>Useful Tips:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>On the sidebar, click on a department to see recommended class pathways.</li>
  <li>Click on any class in a pathway to see the recommended prerequisites and future options available.</li>
  <li>Double click on any class to save it to your "Saved Classes" list for easy future reference.</li>
  <li>Double click any saved class to remove it from your saved classes.</li>
  <li>Click on attached media to view in a larger form.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Just a Recommendation</h4>
<p>The "Year" number doesn't mean a grade level. It indicates how much experience in a pathway is recommended. For example, anyone can take a Intro or Year 1 class, but it is recommended that you have two years of experience (and at least one of the highlighted prior classes) to take a year 3 class.</p>
<p>Some classes will have several "Recommended Before" courses highlighted. You only need at least one class to proceed, not all of the ones that are highlighted (for example, you don't need to take Drawing III, Photo II, and Digital Photo to take AP Studio Art - just one of them is fine!). LAHS classes are open enrollment so you may be able to skip levels with teacher approval. Talk to your teacher or counselor for more details.</p>
