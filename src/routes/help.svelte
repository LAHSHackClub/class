<h3>Using LAHS Classes</h3>
<p>LAHS Classes is a directory of all courses available at Los Altos High School. It shows potential options on what classes you can take, based on the school's recommended student pathways, and helps you plan your next choices.</p>
<h4>Useful Tips:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>On the sidebar, click on a department to see recommended class pathways.</li>
  <li>Click on any class in a pathway to see the recommended prerequisites and future options available.</li>
  <li>Double click on any class to save it to your "Saved Classes" list for easy future reference.</li>
  <li>Double click any saved class to remove it from your saved classes.</li>
  <li>Click on attached media to view in a larger form.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Just a Recommendation</h4>
<p>The "Year" number doesn't mean a grade level. It indicates how much experience in a pathway is recommended. For example, anyone can take a Intro or Year 1 class, but it is recommended that you have two years of experience (and the prerequisites) to take a year 3 class.</p>
<p>Prerequisite classes are only recommendations, and you may be able to skip them with teacher approval. Talk to your teacher or counselor for more details. Additionally, some classes will highlight multiple prerequisite classes, but only one prerequisite is needed to take that class.</p>
